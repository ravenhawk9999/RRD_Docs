= Modular Power Heaters

== Information:
Heaters are used to burn fuel to make heat. They have to be placed on a Boiler Platform. Currently, there are 4 variants: Biomass, Coal, Solution and Nuclear.

Once the heater reaches 100{nbsp}℃ the attached Boiler will then start producing Steam, the temperature will reach 2{nbsp}000{nbsp}℃ for the nuclear heater. 750{nbsp}℃ for the solution heater and 500{nbsp}℃ for the rest.

The heater will produce CO₂, which needs to be handled by either venting through a chimney or accumulating into Carbon Dust. If the CO₂ is not resolved and fills the heater, it will stop producing heat and slowly cool down.
